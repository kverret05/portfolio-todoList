The option selected: Option 1

The components implemented and how they meet the requirements (e.g. parameters, state and input components): Remove task component. 
accepts three props: tasktoRemove, tasks, and setTasks.

UseState: isRemoving is the current state value, and setIsRemoving is the function to update the state value. 

The setIsRemoving function is used to change the value of isRemoving to true when the user confirms the task removal and the removal process begins.
Removal process starts when Remove button is pressed by user. Main issue was getting task to remove from list, could be improved on through revision of portfolio in the future. I ended up figuring out too close to deadline that I needed to use the array taskData I declared in toDoList but was not added to the Remove Task component.
