// this component would consist of sorting tasks by priority: high, medium, and low
// users can sort them through a dropdown menu
// or, it could be a button called "Sort tasks by priority" and there can be a testID called "priority" that is associated with the array of tasks 
// let taskData = [
  // { 
    // description: "Do homework", 
    // completed: false, 
    // key: 1, 
    // priority: high
    // relatedTasks: [2]
    // },
    //  { 
    // description: "Play video games", 
    // completed: false, 
    // priority: low
    // key: 2 
    // },
    // ];
